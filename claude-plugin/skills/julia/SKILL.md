# Julia Development Best Practices

This skill provides guidance for using the persistent Julia REPL via MCP tools. AgentREPL maintains a worker subprocess for code evaluation, eliminating the "Time to First X" (TTFX) startup penalty that normally occurs with each Julia invocation.

## Architecture

AgentREPL uses a **worker subprocess model**:
- The MCP server runs in the main process (STDIO transport)
- Code evaluation happens in a spawned worker process (via Distributed.jl)
- `reset` kills the worker and spawns a fresh one (true hard reset)
- `activate` switches the worker's active project/environment

This architecture enables **type redefinition** after reset, which is impossible with soft resets.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `eval` | Evaluate Julia code with persistent state |
| `reset` | **Hard reset** - kills worker, spawns fresh one (enables type redefinition) |
| `info` | Get session info (version, project, variables, worker ID) |
| `pkg` | Manage packages (add, rm, status, update, instantiate, resolve, test, develop, free) |
| `activate` | Switch active project/environment |

## Critical: Show Code Before Evaluation

**Always display code in a readable format before calling `eval`.** The MCP permission prompt shows code as an escaped string which is difficult for users to read and verify.

Correct workflow:

```
Running this Julia code:
```julia
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean(x)
```

[then call eval with the code]
```

## Understanding TTFX (Time to First X)

The first call to `eval` in a session may take several seconds due to:
- Julia's JIT compilation
- Package loading and precompilation

Subsequent calls are fast because the worker process stays alive with compiled code in memory. This is the core value proposition of AgentREPL.

## Session Persistence

Variables, functions, and loaded packages persist across `eval` calls:

```julia
# First call
x = 42
f(n) = n^2
```

```julia
# Later call - x and f still exist
f(x)  # Returns 1764
```

## Hard Reset with `reset`

The `reset` tool **kills the worker process and spawns a fresh one**. This means:

- All variables are cleared
- All loaded packages are unloaded
- **Type definitions can be changed** (impossible with soft reset)
- The worker starts completely fresh

Use `reset` when:
- You need to redefine a struct or type
- Something is in a bad state
- You want a completely clean slate

After reset, packages need to be reloaded with `using`.

The activated environment persists across resets.

## Environment Management

Julia best practice is to use project-specific environments. Use `activate` to switch environments:

```
activate(path=".")              # Current directory
activate(path="/path/to/proj")  # Specific project
activate(path="@v1.10")         # Named shared environment
```

After activation, install dependencies:
```
pkg(action="instantiate")
```

The activated environment persists even across `reset` calls.

## Package Management

Use `pkg` for all package operations:

**Adding packages:**
```
pkg(action="add", packages="JSON, DataFrames, CSV")
```

**Checking installed packages:**
```
pkg(action="status")
```

**Installing from Project.toml:**
```
pkg(action="instantiate")
```

**Running tests:**
```
pkg(action="test")                    # Test current project
pkg(action="test", packages="MyPkg")  # Test specific package
```

**Development workflow (local packages):**
```
pkg(action="develop", packages="./path/to/MyLocalPackage")  # Use local code
pkg(action="free", packages="MyPackage")                     # Return to registry
```

After adding a package, load it:
```julia
using JSON
```

## Testing Workflow

For running tests, use `pkg(action="test")`:
- With no packages specified, tests the current project
- With packages specified, tests those specific packages
- Test output is captured and displayed

This is preferred over running tests via `eval` because it properly isolates the test environment.

## Development Workflow (Pkg.develop)

When developing a local package alongside your project:

1. **Put the package in develop mode:**
   ```
   pkg(action="develop", packages="./MyLocalPackage")
   ```

2. **Make changes to the package source code**

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```
   pkg(action="test", packages="MyLocalPackage")
   ```

4. **When done, return to registry version:**
   ```
   pkg(action="free", packages="MyLocalPackage")
   ```

The `develop` action accepts:
- Relative paths starting with `./` or `../`
- Absolute paths starting with `/`
- Home-relative paths starting with `~`
- Package names (for developing registered packages from source)

## Error Handling

Common issues and solutions:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `UndefVarError` | Variable not defined | Re-run earlier code or check spelling |
| `MethodError` | Wrong argument types | Check function signatures |
| `LoadError` | Package not installed | Use `pkg(action="add", packages="...")` |
| `cannot redefine` | Type redefinition | Use `reset` for a fresh worker |
| `StackOverflowError` | Infinite recursion | Fix recursion, may need `reset` |

## First-Time Setup

**When first using Julia in a session**, ask the user about their environment preference before running code:

> "Before we start, which Julia environment should I use?
> 1. **Current directory** - activate Project.toml in this folder (if it exists)
> 2. **Specific project** - provide a path to a Julia project
> 3. **Default** - use the global environment
>
> This determines where packages are installed and what dependencies are available."

Based on their answer:
- Option 1: `activate(path=".")` then `pkg(action="instantiate")`
- Option 2: `activate(path="/their/path")` then `pkg(action="instantiate")`
- Option 3: Proceed without activation (uses default environment)

## Practical Workflow

For a typical Julia task:

1. **First use**: Ask about environment (see above)
2. **Activate and install**: `activate` + `pkg(action="instantiate")`
3. **Show code to user**, then call `eval`
4. **Build incrementally** - variables persist across calls
5. **Run tests**: `pkg(action="test")` to verify changes
6. **Use `reset`** if types need redefining or state is corrupted

## Multi-line Code

Multi-line code blocks work naturally:

```julia
function fibonacci(n)
    if n <= 1
        return n
    end
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
end

[fibonacci(i) for i in 1:10]
```

## Output Capture

Both return values and printed output are captured. Results are shown in this order for better visibility:
1. **Result** (or Error) - shown first for collapsed view
2. **Output** - any printed text
3. **Code** - the executed code (user already saw it before approving)

## When NOT to Use These Tools

Prefer direct bash commands when:
- Running a standalone Julia script: `julia script.jl`
- Running with specific command-line flags
- The task is one-shot and doesn't benefit from persistence

Use the MCP tools when:
- Interactive development and exploration
- Iterative work where state should persist
- Avoiding TTFX overhead matters
- Package development workflow
